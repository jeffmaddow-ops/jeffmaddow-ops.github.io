Continuous Learning Through Building, Testing, and Improving

This repository serves as a living portfolio focused on continuous learning through hands-on QA, automation, and implementation work. Each project is designed to reflect real-world scenarios rather than isolated tutorials or theoretical examples.

The goal is simple: learn by doing, validate assumptions through testing, and improve through iteration.

What You’ll Find Here
	•	QA & Test Engineering: Test strategies, automation frameworks, validation workflows, and exploratory testing examples
	•	Automation: Scripts and tools built to reduce manual effort, improve reliability, and surface issues earlier
	•	Integrations & Implementations: Practical work around APIs, platform integrations, and system interactions
	•	Enterprise-Inspired Scenarios: Projects influenced by real production environments and customer-facing challenges

Philosophy
	•	Continuous learning beats static expertise
	•	Practical solutions matter more than perfect code
	•	Testing is a product enabler, not a checkbox
	•	Assumptions are meant to be challenged

How to Use This Repository

Explore individual projects to see the problem being addressed, the approach taken, and the lessons learned. Many projects evolve over time as tools, requirements, or understanding change.

This portfolio is intentionally iterative. Improvements, refactors, and experimentation are part of the process.
